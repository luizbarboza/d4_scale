Diverging scales are similar to [linear scales](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/topics/Linear%20scales-topic.html), but the input domain and output range always have exactly three elements. Diverging scales are typically used for a color encoding; see [d4_scale_chromatic](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale_chromatic/latest/). These scales do not expose [invert](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleContinuousNumberExtension/invert.html) and [interpolate](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleLinear/inerpolate.html) methods. There are also [log](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleDivergingLog.html), [pow](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleDivergingPow.html), and [symlog](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleDivergingSymlog.html) variants of diverging scales.
