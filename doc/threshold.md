Threshold scales are similar to [quantize scales](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/topics/Quantize%20scales-topic.html), except they allow you to map arbitrary subsets of the domain to discrete values in the range. The input domain is still continuous, and divided into slices based on a set of threshold values. See [this choropleth](https://observablehq.com/@d3/threshold-choropleth) for an example.
