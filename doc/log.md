Logarithmic (“log”) scales are like [linear scales](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/topics/Linear%20scales-topic.html) except that a logarithmic transform is applied to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. The mapping to the range value *y* can be expressed as a function of the domain value *x: y = m log(x) + b*.

**CAUTION:** As log(0) = -∞, a log scale domain must be **strictly-positive or strictly-negative**; the domain must not include or cross zero. A log scale with a positive domain has a well-defined behavior for positive values, and a log scale with a negative domain has a well-defined behavior for negative values. (For a negative domain, input and output values are implicitly multiplied by -1.) The behavior of the scale is undefined if you pass a negative value to a log scale with a positive domain or vice versa.
