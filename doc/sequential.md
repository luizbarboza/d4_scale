Sequential scales are similar to [linear scales](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/topics/Linear%20scales-topic.html), but the input domain and output range always have exactly three elements. Sequential scales are typically used for a color encoding; see also [d4_scale_chromatic](hhttps://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale_chromatic/latest/d4_scale_chromatic/d4_scale_chromatic-library.html). These scales do not expose [invert](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleContinuousNumberExtension/invert.html) and [interpolate](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleLinear/inerpolate.html) methods. There are also [log](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleSequentialLog.html), [pow](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleSequentialPow.html), and [symlog](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleSequentialSymlog.html) variants of sequential scales.
