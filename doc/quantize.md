Quantize scales are similar to [linear scales](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/topics/Linear%20scales-topic.html), except they use a discrete rather than continuous range. The continuous input domain is divided into uniform segments based on the number of values in (*i.e.*, the cardinality of) the output range. Each range value *y* can be expressed as a quantized linear function of the domain value *x: y = m round(x) + b*. See [the quantized choropleth](https://observablehq.com/@d3/choropleth/2?intent=fork) for an example.
