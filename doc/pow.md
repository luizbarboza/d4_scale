Power (“pow”) scales are similar to [linear scales](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/topics/Linear%20scales-topic.html), except an exponential transform is applied to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Each range value *y* can be expressed as a function of the domain value *x: y = mx^k + b*, where *k* is the exponent value. Power scales also support negative domain values, in which case the input value and the resulting output value are multiplied by -1.
