Linear scales map a continuous, quantitative input [domain](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleLinear/domain.html) to a continuous output [range](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleLinear/range.html) using a linear transformation (translate and scale). If the range is also numeric, the mapping may be [inverted](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_scale/latest/d4_scale/ScaleContinuousNumberExtension.html). Linear scales are a good default choice for continuous quantitative data because they preserve proportional differences. Each range value *y* can be expressed as a function of the domain value *x*: *y* = *mx* + *b*.
